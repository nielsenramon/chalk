Make the most of winter break! Idelic is looking for students in computer
science and related majors at schools in the Pittsburgh area to join us for a
three-week internship this winter.

  on-site at our office in the Strip District

in the Strip District, and/or working remotely. You will be interacting with
your peers and with our team in Slack and on GitHub as well as in person.

  challenges,

  engineers as well as other highly motivated students.
